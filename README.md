# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

In order to determine the effectiveness of the paid Amazon Vine program, reviews in the Video Game Section were analyzed to determine if Vine Reviews had more 5-Star Reviews than Non-Vine Reviews.

## Results

|                          | Non-Vine Reviews | Vine Reviews |
|--------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Number of Reviews        | 40471            | 94           |
| Number of 5-Star Reviews | 15663            | 48           |
| % of 5-Star Reviews      | 38.7%            | 51.06%       |

## Summary

According to the results above, it can be seen that there are way more Non-Vine Reviews compared to Vine Reviews. Therefore, the sample size is too small to provide strong evidence of Vine-Reviews being more effective at getting 5-Star Reviews.

Additionally, Vine Members recieve the products they are reviewing for free from the amazon sellers, this thus could lead to a positivity bias. Reviewers may be more lenient with reviewing and overlook any flaws as they had received the product for free.
